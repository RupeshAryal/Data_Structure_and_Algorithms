# Data_Structure_and_Algorithms
Complete under graduate level data structure and algorithm course. (Its not tutorial, more like personal note)

This repository contains all the summary and notes of primary data structure and their implementations using c and c++.
I have written pseudo codes in comments as well so  you can use them in any of the programming languages you are familiar or more comfortable with.

If you see any typos or conceptual error do leave a comment or make pull requests.

Lastly, if you are here looking for tutorials and articles for indepth explanation of the topics, you are in the wrong place. This is I repeat more 
of a summary or notes I made while I was learning the subject. If you are lost and wants recommendation for the course, check out abdul bari youtube channel. The link is :- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZCFT11CWBi3MHNlGf019nw (covers algorithm and their analysis)

For data structures, he also offers an udemy course, which is what I followed to learn the subject.
He is, in my opinion, the best teacher for the subject in the internet. The link for the course is below:
