Huffman coding is used to compress text file without losing any data
character are transmitted in a text file in ascii code format which is of 8 bit fixed length,
it isn't efficent way of storing text as some letters (eg: e, t) occur more frequently than others,
if we are able to use variable size bit length than text files can be stored in a disk occupying minimal space.
However, the problem with variable size bit length is computers generally do not have a way of delimetering bit string,
For example, if we use 001 to denote 'e', 0 to denote a whitespace, and 1 to interpret letter 'a' and given a bit string
001001 computers cannot differentiate if its 'ee' or e followed by two space and a ('e  a') or if it's ('  ae')

Huffman coding is a compression technique which counts the frequency of the characters that appears in the text file,
it then sorts the character based on the frequency, removes the two minimum elements and then store them in a tree with their sum as
the root.
